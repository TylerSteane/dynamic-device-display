# API Usage

## Adding Additional Device Definitions

The library will automatically read all xml files in the assets folder and generate a UI for each, assuming they are compliant. To add additional device definitions, all that is needed is to create new xml files in the assets directory and run the application.

To do this, right clicking the assets folder and click **New > File**

Name the file anything you like, for example `myDevice.xml` and add your device definition xml.
